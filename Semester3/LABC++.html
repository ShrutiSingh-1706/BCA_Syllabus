            <h2>BCA-306: Lab on C++</h2>
            <p><span>Exercise 1: Implement Various Control Structure</span>Write programs to use: if..else, switch..case, for loop, while loop, print the different pyramid structure.</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 2: Structure and Unions</span>i) Create a structure called employee with the following details as variables within it - name,age,designation,salary ii) Write a c++ program to create array of objects for the structure to access these and print the name,age designation and salary </p>
            <p><span>Exercise 3: Pointer Arithmetic</span>i) Write a program to find the numvber of vowels present in the given character array using pointer arithmetic</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 4: Functions</span>i) Write a Program to print the given number in reverse order using function. ii) Write a C++ program to find the sum of factorial of a given number using recursive function</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 5: Operators</span>Write a C++ program to perform different arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, modulus and multiplication using inline function</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 6: Storage Specifier</span>i) Write a program to swap two number by both call by value and call by refernce mechanism, using two functions swap_value() and swap_refernce </p>
            <p><span>Exercise 7: Constructor and Destructor</span> Create a class for counting the number of objects created and destroyed within various block using Constructor and destructor</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 8: using "this" pointer</span>1)  Write a program to create three objects for a class named pntr_obj with data members such as roll_no and name. Create a member function set_data() for setting value and print which object has invoked it using 'this' pointer</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 9: Inheritence</span>i) Write a program with different class related through multiple inheritence and demonstrate the use of different access specifiers by means of member variables and memeber functions.</p>
            <p><span>Exercise 10: overload operators</span>1) Write a program to create two obbjects of a class called company and add their data memebers using an operator overloaded function for '+' operator and '-' operator</p>
