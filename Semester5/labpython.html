            <h2>BCA-506: Lab on Python & Web Technology</h2>
            <p><span>Python Programming: </span><br><br><b><u>Programming in Python Lab Practical:</u></b><br>1. Using for loop, print a table of Celsius/Fahrenheit equivalences. Let c be the Celsius temperatures ranging from 0 to 100, for each value of c, print the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.
                Program 2. Using while loop, produce a table of sins, cosines and tangents. Make a variable x in range from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.2. For each value of x, print the value of sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x). Program 3. Write a program that reads an integer value and prints-leap yearl or-not a leap year. Program 4. Write a program that takes a positive integer n and then produces n lines of output shown as follows. For example enter a size: 5
                Program 5. Write a function that takes an integer _n' as input and calculates the value of 1 + 1/1!+1/2+1/3+...+1/n
                Program 6. Write a function that takes an integer input and calculates the factorial of that number. Program 7. Write a function that takes a string input and checks if it's a palindrome or not. Program 8. Write a list function to convert a string into a list, as in list (abc') gives (a, b, c). Program 9. Write a program to generate Fibonacci series.
                Program 10. Write a program to check whether the input number is even or odd. Program 11. Write a program to compare three numbers and print the largest one.
                Program 12. Write a program to print factors of a given number.
                Program 13. Write a method to calculate GCD of two numbers.
                Program 14. Write a program to create Stack Class and implement all its methods. (Use Lists). Program 15. Write a program to create Queue Class and implement all its methods. (Use Lists) Program 16. Write a program to implement linear and binary search on lists.
                Program 17. Write a program to sort a list using insertion sort and bubble sort and selection sort.
